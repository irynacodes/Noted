# Noted 

## What is it?

Noted is a very... unique application. Unique not in its idea, but in its execution. It is a music streaming platform that runs completely and totally in the console. Unconventional and limiting, sure, but it uses this limitation to its advantage ‚Äì the simple, straightforward interface is impossible to get lost in.

## How did it come about?

I created this application as my final project for a C# class (PV178 at Masaryk University). The topic for the project left a lot of room for creativity ‚Äì the only two requiremenets were:

- work with persistent storage (whether database or filesystem)
- make use of multithreading or asynchronous programming

Other than that, the topic and type of project were completely up to us. The reference topics were expense and tournament managers, but I knew that none of that would satisfy my need for my work to be **fun**. A Spotify knockoff, I thought, would do it. And it did! This was pretty much the first project I have ever created on my own (or ever, for that matter), four semesters after writing my first ever Hello World program üåç

## What exactly can it do?

Though Noted appears simple, it actually offers a broad range of functionalities.

### Streaming

The main functionaity of any music streaming app is, well, streaming. And Noted does that quite alright! Users can:
- view all songs available on the platform
- view songs that they have added to their library
- view song suggested to them by Noted based on music tastes of their friends

Any song can be:
- viewed (its title, artist and album are displayed)
- added/removed to/from library
- added/removed to/from a playlist
- played (currently only supported by MacOS)

Any playlist or library can be:
- shuffled (a random song will start playing)

### Social

Like any fun streaming platform, Noted supports and promotes user interactions. Any user can:
- view their own profile (that they can edit, view their friends or blocked users)
- add another Noted user to friends (which enables them to view their library)
- block another Noted user (which removes them from friends, thus hiding their library from the user)
- access their song suggestions that are based on what their friends are listening to

## How do I use it?

If you are using an IDE (e.g. Rider, Visual Studio), all you need to do is run the project with one button click ‚Äì and you are good to go. If you would like to run the project directly from your built-in terminal console, then the process is a little less straightforward, but trivial nevertheless. The steps are:
1. make sure you have .NET SDK installed on your machine (`dotnet --version`)
2. navigate to the project's directory
3. build the project (`dotnet build`)
4. run the project (`dotnet run`)
